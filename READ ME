This notebook was created to analyze possible OVER/UNDER parlay combinations in the NBA.

We are looking for out of the norm matchups or team that's have strong odds of overperforming some benchmark like 105+ pts.

Using that data we can make several educated guesses about the outcomes of matches and use portfolio theory to craft the correct allocations of money.
